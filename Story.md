SCREEN 1:
Opening on planning with option to go loud through front door (TRACK 1) or quiet through sewers (TRACK 2) OPTIONAL and can choose between gun and screwdriver

TRACK 1 Loud :

S1:

Openings on front entrance, plays screaming noises, fades to black then opens inside with everyone on the ground. The user is then able to decide weather to assign a crew member to crowd control or not. If so then the silent alarm is not hit, therefor no timing change, but the overall take is lower as there are less people to carry out money. If the user chooses not to assign a crew member to crowd control, there is a 2/3 change that the someone hits the silent alarm, taking 1 minute off your time, but the crew can carry more out

S2:

The bank vault front is shown and the user is given the choice to drill into the vault or blow it up, if the user chooses blow up the door, there is a 50/50 chance a team member gets blown up, therefor further reducing the take, if the user chooses the drill, there will be another 30 second time reduction. If time allows more complex interfaces can be added with deeper mechanics including wiring a bomb or overheating the drill.

S3:

Opens on interior of the bank vault, if user choose to blow up door, there is a smoke effect, otherwise nothing happens. There is a security gate inside the vault that is secured with a code pad. The code will be randomly generated using the random code API. The code is hidden on the sticky note somewhere. Once the user inputs the code the door swings open and the user can drag and drop money into the cash bags of the remaining crew members. The user then selects to exit the vault.

S4:

Screen opens in to back interior again, on the way out a team member will trip and fall. The user can choose to continue on without them, sacrificing their portion of the take, or spend 30 seconds to help them, saving their take.

S5 (END):

If the user has successfully escaped, they will be presented with a mission success screen, displaying tracked statistics about their play through.


FAILURE:

The user is presented with 1 of a selection of messages informing them that they have failed.


TRACK 2 Quiet :
