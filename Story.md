SCREEN 1:
Opening on planning with option to go loud through front door (TRACK 1) or quiet through sewers (TRACK 2) OPTIONAL and can choose between gun and screwdriver

TRACK 1 Loud :

S1:

Openings on front entrance, plays screaming noises, fades to black then opens inside with everyone on the ground. The user is then able to decide weather to assign a crew member to crowd control or not. If so then the silent alarm is not hit, therefor no timing change, but the overall take is lower as there are less people to carry out money. If the user chooses not to assign a crew memeber to crowd control, there is a 2/3 change that the someone hits the silent alarm, taking 1 minute off your time, but the crew can carry more out

S2:

The bank vault front is shown and the user is given the choice to drill into the vault or blow it up, if the user chooses blow up the door, there is a 50/50 chance a team member gets blown up, therefor further reducing the take, if the user chooses the drill, there will be another 30 second time reduction. If time allows more complex interfaces can be added with deeper mechanics including wiring a bomb or overheating the drill.


TRACK 2 Quiet :
