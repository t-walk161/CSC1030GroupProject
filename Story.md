SCREEN 1:
Opening on planning with option to go loud through front door (TRACK 1) or quiet through sewers (TRACK 2) OPTIONAL and can choose between gun and screwdriver

TRACK 1 Loud :
Openings on front entrance, plays screaming noises, fades to black then opens inside with everyone on the ground. The user is then able to decide weather to assign a crew member to crowd control or not. If so then the silent alarm is not hit, therefor no timing change, but the overall take is lower as there are less people to carry out money. If the user chooses not to assign a crew memeber to crowd control, there is a 2/3 change that the someone hits the silent alarm, taking 1 minute off your time, but the crew can carry more out


TRACK 2 Quiet :
