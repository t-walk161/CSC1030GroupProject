Basic Idea: Heist Game with multiple endings based on desicions made throughout the games middle stage

Text adventure game, with multiple endings based on decisions made throughout the game.

KEY FEATURES 
• The game must be personalised by using information collected from HTML form elements and any other 
data sources that may be appropriate. 
• The ’Game Play’ element must incorporate JavaScript timed events and automatically end the game after no more than 
five minutes (per playthrough).  
• The game should remain true to its roots as a ‘text-driven’ experience, however, a range of media such as images, video, 
audio effects/music, animations and other modern techniques should be incorporated to enhance player experience.    
• Remember, be mindful of copyright and intellectual property.  Ensure you use your own or ‘free to use’ content.  If ‘free 
to use’ content has been incorporated within your project, ensure it attributed in the code and documentation. 
• A series of statistics about the user’s performance in the game must be collected and displayed in the ‘Game Summary’, 
e.g. time taken to complete, number of attempts taken at the game in the current session or some objectively measured 
scoring systems. 
• The game should embed a range of suitable accessibility features to ensure that the game may be enjoyed by those with 
additional needs.  
• The  game  should  meaningfully  incorporate  at  least  two  of  the  APIs  provided  along  with  this  assignment.    Technical 
documentation for these APIs is available on Canvas alongside this assignment specification.  

The variables we will be tracking are- 
1) Time
2) Money (take)
3) Clicks made

The apis we will be using are-
1) RandomCode  (for the valut code)
2) ???

There will be two different ways the player can carry out the heist. Quiet and Loud. Both ways can result in success or failure. Also some of he decisions made can result in the player being caught by the police, which will result in a game over. As well as as this some decisons can be made which effects the gameplay such as time being lost and more take(score) being lost or gained.
