Basic Idea: Heist Game with multiple endings based on desicions made throughout the games middle stage

Text adventure game, with multiple endings based on decisions made throughout the game.

The variables we will be tracking are- 
1) Time
2) Money (take)
3) Clicks made

The apis we will be using are-
1) RandomCode  (for the valut code)
2) ???

There will be two different ways the player can carry out the heist. Quiet and Loud. Both ways can result in success or failure. Also some of he decisions made can result in the player being caught by the police, which will result in a game over. As well as as this some decisons can be made which effects the gameplay such as time being lost and more take(score) being lost or gained.
